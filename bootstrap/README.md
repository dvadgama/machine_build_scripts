  - This files says
     - from where to get [puppetfile](https://github.com/dvadgama/puppetfile.git) and, where to deploy it i.e. "/etc/puppet/environments/" in this case
     - from where to get [hiera-data](https://github.com/dvadgama/puppet_data.git) and, where to deploy it i.e. "/etc/puppet/data/" in thid case
- deploy r10k in default "master" environment.This default environemt is master because, that is the only and default branch in git repo, pointed by /etc/r10.yaml.
  - deployment does two things
    - it installs module listed in [puppetfile](https://github.com/dvadgama/puppetfile/blob/master/Puppetfile)  under /etc/puppet/environments/master
    - it installs [hiera-data](https://github.com/dvadgama/puppet_data.git) under /etc/puppet/data/master/
- Once all of it is done , install the hiera config  & puppetmaster with 'puppet apply'
